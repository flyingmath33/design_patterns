This is a single thread version of stock price management.

It supports three operations:
1. add/update the company name and its price at the current time.
2. display the k companies with top prices. The displayed order is ascending with the prices.
3. It supports alternative method to sort StockInfo. Here, I only implement the heap method. 
   A quick select way is also a candidate for this issue.
